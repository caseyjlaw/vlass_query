# vlass_query and FIRST J141918.9+394036

## Python module and results on FIRST J141918.9+394036.

This repo includes code, data, and analysis related to the Very Large Array Sky Survey data analysis.

1) Import Python module `get_vlass.py` to use functions for querying NRAO VLASS 1.1 quick look image release.
This will likely be superseded by proper data release and/or new tools being produced by CIRADA.

2) The jupyter notebook includes analysis of radio transient FIRST J141918.9+394036.
Clone the repo, load `J141918.855+394036.03.ipynb` in Jupyter or nteract, and execute
all cells to reproduce original analysis and plots.
This repo also includes GRB simulation and radio source fitting results used as input to the notebook.

See [Law et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08964) for the first compiled version of the
FIRST J141918.9+394036 paper.
